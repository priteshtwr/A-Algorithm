# A*-Algorithm

This project aims at providing at solution for finding the most feasible path from Point A to Point B.Using A* algorithm.
The famous Diijkstra algorithm is an exception of A* star algorithm.
Java language is used for implementation.
You can find the algorithm in the docs folder.
The IDE used for development is Eclipse.
