# A*-Algorithm

This project aims at providing at solution for finding the most feasible path from Point A to Point B.Using A* algorithm.
The famous Diijkstra algorithm is an exception of A* star algorithm.Java language is used for implementation.
The IDE used for development is Eclipse.

Below are the folder the names and description of what it contains :-
1. Algorithm - Contains document which takes you through the algorithm used to solve the problem.
2. Guidelines_To_Import_Project - Contains step by step procedure as to how to run the project.
3. Improvements :Contains document which suggests how to make the present solution more better.
4. Problem Statement :Contains all the documents related to the problem statement.
5. Solution :Contains large_map.txt with the path followed to reach the destination.
6. Source Code: As the name suggests contains the source code for the solution.

Cheers!!!
